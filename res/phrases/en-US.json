  "royalRansomIntro1" : "Lily: Cool! I'd like to be a princess and ride my ponies all day! Ben: Unfortunately, a village near King Max's castle was destroyed by a dragon recently. While helping to rebuild, one of his princess daughters was kidnapped by bandits! Lily: Those meanies! I bet they'll only release her if King Alex pays them a lot of gold, right? Ben: Right! But since he already spent all his gold on the village, King Max is counting on us to help him collect all 60 COINS save his daughter. We'll need 5 COINS in each area we come across. Let's get started!",
  "royalRansom1Intro0" : "Ben: Thanks to us, Princess Anna is still safe in the castle! We even got that neat Royal Cape too! Ben: But now they need our help again!

Ben: Now it's time for our biggest royal mission yet! King Max needs coins to hire an expert bandit hunters to put a stop to all the kidnapping! Alexa Speechcon: bravo!  Lily: Good idea! Let's help catch them before King Max himself gets caught! I've heard he sleepwalks in the castle gardens at night! Alexa: Do you know anyone who walks or talks in their sleep, FEARLESS HERO?",
  "royalRansom2Intro1" : "Lily: Cool! My dad snores really loud. That's worse than sleep walking! Ben: We'll need more coins than ever before — 180 COINS — but it'll be worth it! Ben: We can make it if we get 15 COINS in each area. Follow me! Lily: Lead the way, big brother!",

  "pirateBayIntro1" : "Ben: I like it! You'll be the captain while I'll be your lookout, which means I'll let you know if we're approaching something dangerous. Lily: What about me? Ben: You can swab the poop deck, hahaha! Lily: No way!",
  "pirateBay1Intro0" : "Ben: Here we are in Pirate Bay! And guess what, you'll be the captain of our ship! Alexa: What cool captain name are you giving yourself?",

Lily: No problem! I'm sure it'll cost the same as the other instruments, right? Ben: Not exactly.
